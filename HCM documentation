System Purpose
Based on the visible components, this appears to be a Human Resource Management System (HRMS) with a focus on compensation and HR intelligence. The system is designed to handle core HR functions with particular emphasis on:

Employee compensation management
HR data analytics and intelligence
Payroll processing
Benefits administration

Documentation Structure
From what I can observe, the documentation appears to follow a modular approach:
HUMAN RESOURCE 4 - Compensation & HR Intelligence seems to be a major module or version that encompasses:

Core Human Capital Management (HCM)
Payroll Management
Compensation Planning
HR Analytics Dashboard
HMO & Benefits Administration

Database Structure Analysis
While I can't see the complete database schema in this image, the module names suggest a normalized database structure likely organized around:
Core Entities:

Employee/Human Capital records
Compensation structures
Payroll data
Benefits/HMO information
Analytics/reporting data

Likely Architecture:

HCM Core: Central employee data management
Payroll Module: Salary calculations and payment processing
Compensation Planning: Salary structures, performance-based pay
Analytics Dashboard: Business intelligence for HR metrics
Benefits Administration: Insurance, HMO, and employee benefits tracking

The modular structure suggests a well-architected system that separates concerns while maintaining data integrity across HR functions. This would typically involve foreign key relationships between employee records and their associated compensation, payroll, and benefits data.
