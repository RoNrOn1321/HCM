Feasibility Assessment
✅ What Works Well:

Core CRUD Operations: PHP excels at database interactions and form processing
MySQL: Perfect for HR data with proper normalization and indexing
Tailwind: Excellent for creating professional, responsive UI quickly
Vanilla JS: Sufficient for dynamic interactions, form validation, and AJAX calls
Postman: Great for API testing during development

⚠️ Challenges You'll Face:
1. Security Implementation

You'll need to manually implement authentication, session management, CSRF protection
Password hashing, input sanitization, and SQL injection prevention
Role-based access control from scratch

2. Code Organization

Without frameworks, maintaining clean architecture becomes your responsibility
Need to create your own routing system, MVC structure
Database connection management and query builders

3. Complex Features

Payroll calculations with tax rules and deductions
Report generation and data export functionality
Real-time notifications and email systems
