● 📋 How Employees Login and Use Attendance

  Step 1: Web Application Login

  1. Navigate to: http://localhost/HCM/views/login.php
  2. Enter credentials:
    - Username: admin (or hr_manager)

  Step 2: Access Attendance Page

  1. From Dashboard: Click "Attendance" in sidebar        
  menu
  2. Direct URL:
  http://localhost/HCM/views/attendance.php

  Step 3: Clock In/Out Operations

  Once on the attendance page, employees see:

  Quick Actions Panel:
  - ✅ Clock In Button (if not clocked in)
  - ❌ Clock Out Button (if clocked in)

  - 📊 Real-time Status Display

  🔄 Current Attendance Workflow

  Clock In → 4. Work → 5. Breaks → 6. Clock Out

  What Employees See:

  When NOT clocked in:

  - Disabled break buttons
  - Status shows "Clocked Out"

  When clocked in:
  - Red "Clock Out" button

  🚀 Would you like me to enhance the system?

  I can add several improvements:

  Option 1: Quick Login Page

  Create a simplified attendance-only login page

  Option 2: Employee Portal

  Dedicated employee interface with just attendance       
  features

  Option 3: Mobile-Friendly Interface

  Touch-optimized attendance for tablets/phones

  Option 4: Kiosk Mode

  Full-screen attendance terminal for shared devices      

  Option 5: API-Only Access

  For integration with badge scanners or mobile apps      

  Would you like me to implement any of these
  enhancements, or do you have specific requirements      
  for how employees should access the attendance
  system?
